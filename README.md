# Network-cable-tester
This project was carried out in the first year of a bachelor's degree in computer science at the Haute Ã©cole en Hainaut.

The purpose of the project is to check the operating status of a network cable (RJ45).
The cable tester includes the LED module and the PIC module. 
2 versions of the PCB have been made, the first one allows to be engraved only in single layer and the second one in double layer (space saving) .

In terms of PIC programming (PIC16F628A), 3 modes have been implemented: 
1. a short press of the button switches to the next LED
2. a long press speeds up the process by automatically switching to the following LED
3. a longer press lights up all the LEDs at the same time

# Usage

You can test the project with the Proteus simulation software and the right cabling.

You can also try it in real with a breadboard, the right hardware and MPlab software to upload the code into the PIC.

You must use the compiled file NetworkCableTester.hex

For more information, you can consult the report detailing the software and hardware used and more detailed explanations (in French).
